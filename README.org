* NetCDF

This is a *very* rough set of bindings to the NetCDF library. Mainly
aimed at the NetCDF classic files (as the NetCDF4 files can be read
via [[https://github.com/Vindaar/nimhfd5][nimhdf5]].

** NetCDF shared library name

If the NetCDF shared library is not called =(lib)netcdf.so/dll/dynlib=
(linux, windows, osx) on your system, you can overwrite the name
using:
#+begin_src nim
-d:netcdf=newName
#+end_src
This will set the name to =(lib)newname.so/dll/dynlib=
